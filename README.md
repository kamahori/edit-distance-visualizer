# Edit Distance Visualizer

A web-based tool that visualizes the Levenshtein distance (edit distance) between strings. This interactive application helps users understand the operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

## Features

- Compare a reference string against multiple target strings
- Dynamic visualization of edit operations with color coding:
  - Green: Matching characters
  - Blue: Insertions
  - Red: Deletions
  - Yellow: Substitutions
- Add or remove target strings on the fly
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Detailed breakdown of each edit operation

## How to Use

1. Enter your reference string in the top text area
2. Enter one or more target strings to compare against
3. View the color-coded visualization and operation details
4. Add more target strings using the "Add Target String" button

## Example

The default example shows the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting", a classic example that requires 3 operations to transform.
